    <p>  The Faculty comprises five departments, Department of Natural Resources, Department of Physical Sciences and Technology, Department of Food Science and Technology, Department of Computing and Information Systems and the Department of Sport Sciences and Physical Education.

The Faculty offers B.Sc. (special) degree programmes in Food Science and Technology, Environmental Sciences & Natural Resource Management, Chemical Technology, Computer Science & Technology, Applied Physics, Computing and Information Systems, Sports Science and Management and Physical Education for the students who gain direct entry to the faculty on the basis of their performance at the GCE (A/L) Examination. The degree programs are designed to be four-year degree programs with an exit point at three years for the students who graduate with a general degree in B.Sc. in Physical Sciences and Technology and Environmental Sciences and Management.   The rest of the degree programs are strictly four-year degree programs.

The selection of the students for the B.Sc. degree programmes in Computing and Information Systems, Sports Sciences and Management and Physical Education was performed on the basis of the G.C.E. (A/L) results as well as the performance at a selection aptitude test. The students who wish to get enrolled for the degree programmes in Sports Sciences and Management and Physical Education were also required to face an examination for physical fitness in addition to the selection test. However, the selection procedure has been changed by the UGC through a circular and there will not be any further aptitude tests for the recruitment of undergraduates for the Faculty. 

All degree programs offered through the faculty are designed to cater to the current job trends and demands both nationally and internationally. They are conducted exclusively in English. These degree programmes are designed as interdisciplinary by incorporating subjects as Computer Science, Economics, Management, etc. that has facilitated our students to perform well once graduating serving a wider field than being specific and narrowed to than specialized field. 

Apart from the academic activities the Faculty also contributes to the development of the community and the nation through extension and knowledge Dissemination programmes.  The staff and the students participate in such activities annually.  </p>
