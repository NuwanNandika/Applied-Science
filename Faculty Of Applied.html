<p> The Faculty of Applied Sciences of the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka was initially started as the Buttala Affiliated University College (BAUC) on 21st June 1993. The BAUC offered two diploma courses, one in Food Science and Technology and the other in English Language. 

<br><br>
With the elevation of the Affiliated University Colleges to fully fledged national Universities in early 1996, three Affiliated University Colleges; Sabaragamuwa Affiliated University College, Uva Affiliated University College and Buttala Affiliated University College were amalgamated to form the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka and the BAUC became the Faculty of Applied Sciences of the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. With effect from March 2008, the faculty has been relocated in the main campus premises at Belihuloya.  </p>

<div class="row" id="current">
<div class="col-md-8">
<p> The Faculty of Applied Sciences comprises five departments; the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Physical Sciences & Technology, Department of Food Science & Technology, Department of Computing & Information Systems and Department of Sports Management & Physical Management. The Faculty offers B.Sc. (Special) degree programmes in Food Science and Technology, Environmental Sciences and Natural Resources Management, Chemical Technology, Computer Science and Technology, Applied Physics, Computing and Information Systems, Sports Science and Management and Physical Education for the students who gain direct entry to the Faculty on the basis of their performance at the GCE (Advanced Level) examination. Students for Food Science and Technology degree programme are selected through a separate window from the GCE (Advanced Level) Bio Science stream, while students selected from the Applied Sciences Window from the GCE (Advanced Level) bio science stream and GCE (Advanced Level) physical science stream are entitled for degree programmes on Environmental Sciences and Natural Resources Management and Physical Sciences & Technology respectively.

The selection of the students for the B.Sc. degree programmes in Computing and Information Systems, Sports Science and Management and Physical Education is done on the basis of the G.C.E. (A/L) results as well as the performance at a selection test. The students who wish to get enrolled for the degree programmes in Sports Science and Management and Physical Education are also required to face an examination for physical fitness in addition to the selection test.

Even though the faculty conducts four year (Special) degree programmes, students who enrol for B.Sc. degree programmes in Environmental Sciences and Natural Resources Management, and Physical Sciences have an option to exit at the end of the third year.

The degree programmes are designed to suit the needs of the rapidly changing economic environment while taking into consideration employment opportunities for graduates who pass out from the University. The programmes are conducted exclusively in English. The Faculty also contributes to the development of the community and the nation through its extension programmes.
