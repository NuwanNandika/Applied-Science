    <p>The Department of Computing and Information Systems which offers a B.Sc. Special Degree in Computing and Information Systems was established in 01st March 2011, though the Degree programme was initiated back in 2008. The curriculum is specifically designed to produce skilled graduates both in Computing and Information Technology. At present the department has three well established laboratories and the student capacity of the department is 273

The demand for the above degree programme has greatly increased thorough out the years and annual intake has reached the maximum capacity of 80 students per batch. The department has close collaborations with private computer industries to obtain technical support in conducting lectures and practical as well as to provide opportunities for the undergraduates to carry out their mini projects and final year projects. This also has increased the opportunity for the undergraduates to secure job opportunities immediately after graduation. The staff of the Department consists of one senior lecturer and five probationary lecturers.<br/><br/><br/>
<b>Brief History</b><br/><br/>
In 2008, B Sc Special Degree in Computing and Information Systems was commenced under the Faculty of Applied Sciences and on March 1st, 2011, the Department of Computing & Information Systems was founded. At present, there are four computer laboratories equipped and facilitated  with modern Window sand Linux systems, and a wide variety of up- to-date software including expensive educational tools. High-speed Internet resources are shared among computer laboratories and other buildings via a fiber backbone.
