    <p>The Department of Natural Resources of the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka was established in 1996 offering a B.Sc. General degree in Natural Resources. The degree program offered by the Department is designed to cater to the current job market in the fields of Environmental Protection, Natural Resource Management and Conservation, Biodiversity Conservation and Management, Environmental Advocacy and Ecology both in Sri Lanka and throughout the world.

In 2006 the Degree Programme which was initially offered as B.Sc. in Natural Resources a three-year general degree program was upgraded and restructured to offer a Degree programme as Environmental Science and Natural Resources Management which has improved the job opportunities for the graduates. Currently the degree program is oriented in three major streams viz. Environmental Sciences, Conservation Biology and Earth Sciences with awarding two degree programs as B.Sc. (Special) in Environmental Science and Natural Resources Management – 4 years and B.Sc. (General) in Environmental Science and Natural Resources Management – 3 years. The degree also paves an excellent path for postgraduate studies. The staff of the department consists of one senior professor, four senior lecturers, two probationary lecturers and one temporary lecturer.

At present two probationary lecturers are reading their Ph.D. studies overseas and the senior professor at present is contributing his services to the University as the Vice Chancellor of the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. Many resource persons in specialized fields are invited in conducting lecture and practical courses for undergraduates.</p>
